# Augier-AI-Project

Proposal generation feature web application that allows users to create structured proposals for their businesses. Incorporates an LLM model to allow for quick feedback and tailored suggestions for proposals. Allows for easy switching between proposals.

Potential Updates for the Future:
1. Store created proposals in a database to enable users to leave website and come back but still have access to proposals from previous sessions.
2. Implement a Java Backend to read/write from/to this database
3. Allow for more functionalities with proposals (EX: Allow users to create subsections of proposals for better organization, Allow users to use multiple text styles to highlight and design certain points in proposals)

Also note that you will need to use your own OpenAI GPT Key to access the LLM model.
